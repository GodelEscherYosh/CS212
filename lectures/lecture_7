	look for the very first thing that looks wrong.
	
	//Upcoming projects
		A touch harder that Project 2D

Lecture outline

	Function Prototypes

	What does #include do
		The compiler can only compile one file at a file
	takes another file and includes it in the current file

	The compiler says #include

Demonstrate #sign

	//i need more sleep

UNIONS (go quickly through it)

	Union is a special data type

	typdef union
	{
	int y;
	float x;
	char char[4];
	}
	Now you would think this has 12 bytes because int + float + 4chars
	must be equal to 12 bytes.

	The thing is that this only allocates 4 bytes of memory.
	What is stored is the max possible bytes.
