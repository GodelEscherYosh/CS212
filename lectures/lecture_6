	//Notes about the upcoming exams
		-Mega Quiz is supposed to be very hard in preperation of the Midterm Exam

	//Structs
	
		C Key word struct

		EX: 

		struct Ray
		{
		double direction[3]
		}

		You call structss with r.direction[0] = 1;
		
		So what are Structs?
			-It's just a grouping of variables together
			-In Python we have classes
			-Methods in python and OOP
			-STRUCTS in C do not have anything like that! Instead, Structs is just grouping bytes
			Together

	//Nested Structs
		These are Structs whithin structs

	//Typedef

		Here, we've made a struct, we say struct Ray.


	//FILE I/O

		Two ways to access files:
			-File descriptors
				-Lower level interface to files and devices

			-Type: small integers (typically 20 total)

			-Streams:

				Higher

		Process for reading or writing
			Writing:
			-open a file
				-Telss Unix you intend to do file I/O
			-Function returns a "FILE*
			
			Opening File:
				FILE *handle = fopen(filename, mode);
				
				Example: FILE *h fopen("/tmp/212,

			Reading and Writing:
				-fread()
				-fwrite()

		//This could be on the Exam

			ftell() Tells us the current value of the file position indicatro for the stream pointed to by stream
				->Where is the position indicator (Same as number of bytes in the file):wq
