	//Character strings
		ASCII Character Set
		
	//Printf
		When you print you have a string and all the % to denote the data you want in it

	so the structure is:
	printf("STRING_TO_PRINT + all precents", arg1, arg2, ..., argn)

	char A = "A"
	char NL = '\n'

	and so on

	Q: What if you added something after the null charater. Say you have no null character, and you add a perdio. You want me to oint a string, you gi
ven a pointer to the character. H will keep going.

	//Setting H to be hello world, then we print it.

	//Characters in C vs strings in C

	Characters in C is quotes, 'A'
	Strings in C use double, "This is a string"
